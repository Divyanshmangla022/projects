# Overview
Airline reservation system is one of the most used database systems in the
world. It is basically a type of transaction processing system. Transaction
processing systems are systems with large databases and multiple
concurrent users executing database transactions. These systems require
high availability and fast response time for multiple concurrent users.
In this project, we deal with the database part of the whole system with
insertions, deletions and updates as the primary task of our system along
with maintenance of the integrity of the system at all stages of a transaction.

The website launches with the homepage which contains major information about the facilities offered by the company along with the simple travel search form available at the hero section. The user simply needs to mention the arrival and departure destination along with the suitable date. 
According to the given inputs all the available bus trips will be displayed. Moving to the next step the user will be navigated to the select seat page where with the help of interactive seat map users can select the desired seats along with the selection of boarding and drop point. For the further process, the user will be asked to provide the passenger details as well the contact details along with the complete fare breakup view provided at the bottom.
