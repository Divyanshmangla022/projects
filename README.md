# AIRLINE RESERVATION SYSTEM

techniques used:- DBMS,SQL,etc. 

# Overview
Airline reservation system is one of the most used database systems in the
world. It is basically a type of transaction processing system. Transaction
processing systems are systems with large databases and multiple
concurrent users executing database transactions. These systems require
high availability and fast response time for multiple concurrent users.
In this project, we deal with the database part of the whole system with
insertions, deletions and updates as the primary task of our system along
with maintenance of the integrity of the system at all stages of a transaction.

# OBJECTIVES OF AIRLINE RESERVATION SYSTEM

Improve accuracy.

Result to be received very quickly.

extent that one can obtain or cancel a reservation from any branch for
any route at any given time.

To speed up the operation.

Managing and maintaining data becomes easier.

# CONCLUSION 

The Airline reservation system has been a way of minimizing the clerical work,
which is almost a routine and consumes the most precious time. This
AIRLINE RESERVATION SYSTEM has been an attempt to help the
passenger to minimize his workload along with minimizing the paper works
